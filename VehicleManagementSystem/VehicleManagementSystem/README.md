# Vehicle Management System

I build "Vehicle Management System", a web app that relies upon a MongoDB database and flask.



## Introduction

This system can manage Vehicle's information and provides the following functions:

1. Provides an input interface for Vehicle's information, including Vehicle ID, Vehicle Model, Owner Name and Owner Address.

2. Provide Vehicle's information query interface. Visually display the information of each vehicle in the form of a table. The default is to sort by Vehicle ID from small to large.

3. Support personalized query operations. You can query by id, model, name, address, and five operations(=, <, >, <=, >=) are supported. Remember that your query should contain no spaces. For each user query, a legality judgment will be made .

4. Edit operations are supported. Each row of data records can be edited to update Vehicle ID, Vehicle Model, Owner Name and Owner Address informations in the database.

5. Delete operations are supported. Each row of Vehicle data supports one-click deletion.
